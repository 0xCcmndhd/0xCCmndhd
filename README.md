# Aaron Jefferson (he/they)
Software/Platform Engineer â€¢ Data Analytics â€¢ IAM/Authorization

Systems-focused engineer building secure, automation-first platforms and AI/ML tooling. I turn ambiguous requirements into documented, reproducible systems: Proxmox private cloud, containerized services, perâ€‘app SSO (Authelia + Caddy), and acceptanceâ€‘check workflows.

- Focus: policy-driven authorization (AWS Verified Permissions/Cedar, OPA/Rego), strong DevEx, and practical LLM stacks.
- Certifications (in progress): Hugging Face â€” LLMs & Agents; Google Data Analytics Professional.
- Location: Philadelphia, PA â€¢ Open to Software, Platform/IAM, or Data roles.
